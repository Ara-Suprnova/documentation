# Hosting a Suprnova Pool

As a Pool Host, you provide the initial connection through which all participants will join together to encode your video content.

In order to launch a Pool, a valid source video file is required, and it must be prepared using the Suprnova GUI tool (or the CLI, if you know what you're doing.)
