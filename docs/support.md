# Media & Codec Support

Suprnova, in its initial release, will focus on providing high quality, consistently reliable H.264 transcoding. Tuning our encoder to your use case is simple, by using the Suprnova GUI application for Microsoft Windows 10 UWP.

## Video

At present, videos may be H.264 AVC only. Output codec is limited to H.264 at this time.

In future releases, we will begin supporting a wider range of codecs, and will open up new options for output codec.

## Audio / Subtitle / Text

Any other media track that is compliant with the MPEG-4 container is supported. Suprnova does not touch non-video media tracks, and they will simply be re-muxed into the ouptut MP4 at the end of the encoding procedure.
